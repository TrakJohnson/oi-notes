Hester Prynne remained constant in her resolve to make known to Mr. Dimmesdale, at whatever risk
of present pain or ulterior consequences, the true character of the man who had crept into his
intimacy. For several days, however, she vainly sought an opportunity of addressing him in some of
the meditative walks which she knew him to be in the habit of taking, along the shores of the
peninsula, or on the wooded hills of the neighboring country. There would have been no scandal,
indeed, nor peril to the <b>holy whiteness</b> of the clergyman’s good fame, had she visited him in his own
study; where many a penitent, ere now, had confessed sins of perhaps as deep a die as the one
betokened by the scarlet letter. But, partly that she dreaded the secret or undisguised interference
of old Roger Chillingworth, and partly that her conscious heart imputed suspicion where none could
have been felt, and partly that both the minister and she would need the whole wide world to
breathe in, while they talked together,—for all these reasons, Hester never thought of meeting him
in any <b>narrower privacy than beneath the open sky</b>.

“More misery, Hester!—only the more misery!” answered the clergyman, with a bitter smile. “As
concerns the good which I may appear to do, I have no faith in it. It must needs be a delusion. What
can a ruined soul, like mine, effect towards the redemption of other souls?—or a polluted soul,
towards their purification? And as for the people’s reverence, would that it were turned to scorn and
hatred! Canst thou deem it, Hester, a consolation, that I must stand up in my pulpit, and meet so
many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light of heaven were beaming from it!—must see my
flock hungry for the truth, and listening to my words as if a tongue of Pentecost were speaking!—and
then look inward, and discern the black reality of what they idolize? I have laughed, in bitterness and
agony of heart, at the contrast between what I seem and what I am! And Satan laughs at it!”

“No, Hester, no!” replied the clergyman. “There is no substance in it! It is cold and dead, and can do
nothing for me! <b>Of penance I have had enough! Of penitence there has been none!</b> Else, I should long
ago have thrown off these garments of mock holiness, and have shown myself to mankind as they
will see me at the judgment-seat. Happy are you, Hester, that wear the scarlet letter openly upon
your bosom! Mine burns in secret! Thou little knowest what a relief it is, after the torment of a seven
years’ cheat, to look into an eye that recognizes me for what I am! Had I one friend,—or were it my
worst enemy!—to whom, when sickened with the praises of all other men, I could daily betake
myself, and be known as the vilest of all sinners, methinks my soul might keep itself alive thereby.
Even thus much of truth would save me! But, now, it is all falsehood!—all emptiness!—all death!”

<p>
Pearl, whose activity of spirit never flagged, had been at no loss for amusement while her mother
talked with the old gatherer of herbs. At first, as already told, she had flirted fancifully with her own
image in a pool of water, beckoning the phantom forth, and—as it declined to venture—seeking a
passage for herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky. Soon finding, however,
that either she or the image was unreal, she turned elsewhere for better pastime. She made little
boats out of <b>birch-bark</b>, and freighted them with <b>snail-shells</b>, and sent out more ventures on the
mighty deep than any merchant in New England; but the larger part of them foundered near the
shore. She seized a live <b>horseshoe</b> by the tail, and made prize of several five-fingers, and laid out a jelly-fish to melt in the warm sun. Then she took up the white foam, that streaked the line of the
advancing tide, and threw it upon the breeze, scampering after it with winged footsteps, to catch the
great snow-flakes ere they fell. Perceiving a flock of beach-birds, that fed and fluttered along the
shore, the naughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles, and, creeping from rock to rock after
these small sea-fowl, displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting them. One little gray bird, with a
white breast, Pearl was almost sure, had been hit by a pebble and fluttered away with a broken
wing. <b>But then the elf-child sighed, and gave up her sport; because it grieved her to have done harm
to a little being that was as wild as the sea-breeze</b>, or as wild as Pearl herself.

<p>
Hester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts of the town, <span class="underline">within the verge of the
peninsula</span>, but not in close vicinity to any other habitation, there was a <b>small thatched cottage</b>. It
had been built by an earlier settler, and abandoned, because the soil about it was too sterile for
cultivation, while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which
already marked the habits of the emigrants. It stood on the shore, <b>looking across a basin of the sea</b>
at the forest-covered hills, towards the west. A <span class="underline">clump of scrubby trees</span>, such as alone grew on the
peninsula, did not so much conceal the cottage from view, as seem to denote that here was some
object which would fain have been, or at least ought to be, <b>concealed</b>. In this <span class="underline">little, lonesome
dwelling</span>, with some slender means that she possessed, and by the license of the magistrates, who
still kept an inquisitorial watch over her, Hester established herself, with her infant child.
</p>

<p>
A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot. Children, <span class="underline">too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities</span>, would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottage-window, or standing in the door-way, or
laboring in her little garden, or coming forth along the pathway that led townward; and, discerning
the scarlet letter on her breast, would scamper off, with a <b>strange, contagious fear</b>.

<li>Punishment has followed the Puritains, even as they tried to escape</li>

<p>
Transition: much more private, the burden of crime doesn't come from the others but from the crime itself
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Crime is for the <b>iron-nerved</b>, who have their choice either to endure it, or, if it press too hard, to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose, and fling it off at once!
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scaffold is the symbol of guilt</li>

<p>
Association with the supernatural:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Without any effort of his <b>will</b>, or power to <b>restrain</b> himself, he shrieked aloud
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
All people, in a word, would come stumbling over their thresholds, and turning up their amazed and horror-stricken visages around the scaffold. Whom would they discern there, with the red eastern light upon his brow? Whom, but the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, <b>half frozen to death</b>, <span class="underline">overwhelmed with shame</span>, and standing where <span class="underline">Hester Prynne</span> had stood!
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Transition from the scornful, mocking tone with Hester Prynne, to the shock that Dimmesdale would produce if he stayed there</li>

Words to pick out:

<li>"expiation"</li>
<li>"mad" &rarr; folly, shrieking without wanting, thinking he spoke to Wilson, "phantoms"</li>
<li>"phantoms" &rarr; supernatural, the scaffold freezes Dimmesdale</li>

As darkness lifted the shadows grew
Pale sparse figures, in <b>miserable agony</b>
Were dragged by the halo of hope that appeared
Dwarfed by the giants of cement and steel

<p>
Wretched and broken, the city lay dead
A wounded soldier never to rise again
Its skeleton, bare, weather stained
new yet already a land of despair

The glimmering light shone through the rust
The radiant halo broke struck through the
